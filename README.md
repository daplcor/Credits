 Repo for tracking the purchase of credits

You need to pull the oracle code and modify kadenai-credits.repl, or create a defconst to simulate for testing.

Running this allows a person to purchase credits with KDA, tracks to the price of KDA/USD, and will soon be supported on all 20 chains.  Amounts are picked up via blockchain events and written to a new table for instant access to credits.
